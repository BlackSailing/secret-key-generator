# secret-key-generator

This Python script generates a new key pair for ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) using the SECP256k1 curve, which is commonly used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. 
The private key is randomly generated, and the corresponding public key is derived from it. 
The script then prints the hexadecimal representations of both the private and public keys.
